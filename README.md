All over the internet you can find website templates for a wide variety of sites, webstores, portfolios, etc. But with my search I never found any that suited the needs that I had and later finding that others had too. So I made it a goal to create a portfolio template that was versatile for everybody's needs. 

Here's why:

* Your portfolio tells everybody who you are. So having a unique portfolio makes you stand out.
* You no longer have to search the webs for the most niche template.
* Get creative with it fork the project to add your own features

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

## Built With

Below are few of the coding languages and databases used to host and add various of features to the website.

* [Oracle Databases](https://www.oracle.com/database/)
* [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You're going to want to need any site hosting service and or host off of your local machine

There are a ton of different site hosts that you can use but the one I prefer and recommend is infinity free. It's completely free and allows for the user to port forward their site to a custom domain and includes a file manager. 

### Installation

1. Download all required packages and files from releases

2. Follow INSTALL.md to set up databases and allow file transfers to site

3. Configure website template and upload to site hosting site

4. Configure SQL settings to allow for site to pull from database

5. Publish site

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/LoganLogicDEV/2024portfolio/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
